# ar-image-editor

Run instruction

Use "yarn serve" to run it locally

A basic image editor

a tiny webapp that allows the user too:

Load and display an image file (png or jpg) from the filesystem (using a normal file picker dialog) by clicking on the centre image element,
Once the image has been loaded, the horizontal brightness slider becomes active,
The user can adjust the brightness of the image, in real time, by moving the slider left or right from its centre position to increase brightness by sliding right and decrease brightness by sliding left. NOTE: By "real time" I mean as the slider is dragged, do not wait for a mouse up event to trigger the change in brightness,
EXTRA: If you have time, please add a vertical slider (in the same design as the horizontal slider) that allows the user to adjust the contrast as well (in real time),
